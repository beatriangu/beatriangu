# Hi 👋, I'm Bea! A proud graduate of the first ZIP promotion.

Hello! I'm Bea, a proud graduate of the first ZIP cohort at 42. My journey began with the support of my project partner, Don Juan Sala (Master of the Universe in C), who suggested I should study what `write()` actually does...

One year later ; 2.160 hours, 22 projects submitted, 70 evaluations given, 45 received, and one exam passed (thanks to jmedina's coaching!!), and I have managed to top it all off with my final Django project.

This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the help of Xabi Matute (Supercrack junior from 42), who guided me to find the right spot to place "Miss Daphne" among the apps in the `settings.py` configuration... and magic🪄🌠  happened!

I also want to thank each and every one of my peers (...there aren’t enough letters in the alphabet to name them all, but they are all in the students directory of sgoinfre for sure!) for their support, patience, and help. Because at 42, you are nothing alone. It's about people, brilliant minds, endless paths, diverse solutions, but above all, a passion for helping, sharing, and learning from others. There's a well-deserved rush when you finish a project, and even more so when others do.

I want to express my gratitude to all the people who have evaluated me, and in the final stage, to those 32 transcended ones, so poorly hidden on the 8th floor or behind their screens, but always with a smile, willing to evaluate me and even eager to teach me new things! 😊

Also, a big thank you to the AMAZING Staff (personnel, senseis, and staff at Urduliz) for driving this project forward, for the energy they have invested, and for their constant support! 🙏

My feedback for the project: Outstanding 🚀
